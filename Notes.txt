Issue 1: only contravariant type dependency in Π
  - E.g: ((A : U) → A → A) is not a valid type, because A occurs invariantly
    in the domain type.

  - solution: add formal "core" of the context: context looks like
    Γ|Δ where Γ is a setoid and Δ is a proset fibration over Γ.
    Γ contains all invariant variables, and Δ contains the polar variables.

    Now, invariant Π formation looks like this:

      Γ|∙ ⊢ A type    Γ,A | Δ[wk] ⊢ B type
      ────────────────────────────────
            Γ|Δ ⊢ Π= A B type

  - For ergonomics, it would be nice to add an internal modality for
    invariance.

  - I looked at rules for necessity by Gratzer et al., but necessity
    is not enough, because it only seems to describe closed inhabitants
    but not inhabitants depending only on a modal context.

Issue 2: Only contravariant underlying functions in Π!
  - With the modal invariant contexts, we can sensibly have (A : U) →
    A → A now, but we cannot write down the identity function (λ
    x. x), because it's covariant.
  - TODO: check that covariant + invariant Π underlying functions are
    possible.

Simplified version TODO: Γ|Δ context is modelled by just a set for Γ
and a proset fibration over for Δ. Invariant things are always
discrete.  A proset fibration over a set needs only a family of
homogeneous equivalence relations:

   !   : Γ.! → Set
   R   : ∀ {x} → ! x → ! x → Prop
   rfl : R xx xx
   trs : R xx yy → R yy zz → R xx zz
